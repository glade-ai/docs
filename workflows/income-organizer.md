# Income Organizer

## Overview

The Income Organizer is a tool in bankruptcy workflows that helps attorneys review and organize a client's income data for court form preparation. It collects income from paystubs and other sources, calculates monthly amounts, and feeds the results into bankruptcy schedules — Schedule I (Current Monthly Income of the Debtor) and the Chapter 7 means test, including the median income screen.

## Key Behaviors

### Income Calculation Modes

Each income source (such as a paystub) can be set to one of these calculation modes:

- **Per-paycheck mode**: income amounts are taken directly from individual pay period values.
- **YTD (year-to-date) mode**: monthly amounts are derived by dividing the year-to-date totals by the number of pay periods elapsed. Use this mode when per-period figures are unavailable or less accurate than the running YTD totals.
- **YTD period method**: estimates average monthly income by comparing the year-to-date totals on the paystubs that bracket a chosen six-month period, then dividing the bracketed gross by six. You pick a **filing (test) month**, and Glade treats the six full months before that month as the period to measure. Use this mode to base the figure on a defined window rather than on the full running year-to-date total.

### Period Method Preview

When you choose the YTD period method, a preview shows how the figure is built before you apply it: the filing month you selected, the six-month period that falls before it, how many paystubs were used as the start and end anchors, the breakdown rows that make up the calculation, and the resulting monthly gross. The filing month defaults to the month after the latest paystub that carries year-to-date data, and you can change it.

If you also apply the period method to the means test, a warning banner flags it as a non-standard calculation method so you can confirm it against the case's requirements before relying on it.

### Schedule I Contributions Preview

From within the income organizer, you can open a **Schedule I Contributions** preview that shows how the collected income will appear on Schedule I before the form is generated.

When a paystub is in YTD mode and includes overtime pay:

- **Wages / Salary** and **Overtime** appear as separate line items, showing the monthly breakdown derived from YTD data.
- A **Gross Income** summary row shows the total (wages + overtime), so the additive relationship is visible at a glance.
- This matches what will be reported on Schedule I, where wages and overtime are listed separately.

In per-paycheck mode, amounts are taken directly from the pay period figures.

### Means Test Income Window

For the Chapter 7 means test, a debtor's Current Monthly Income is the average of income across the six full calendar months before the month the case is filed. Glade anchors this six-month window to the **last completed calendar month**, so a month that is still in progress is never included.

- A pay stub dated in the current (still-running) month does not pull the window forward or drop the earliest month. For example, a case worked in June averages December through May, not January through June.
- Cases whose most recent pay stub already falls in a prior month are unaffected — the window is not forced to add empty current-month figures, so the average is not artificially lowered.
- Income sources that do not count toward the means test — Social Security and government assistance (such as welfare or food stamps) — are left out of the six-month average. They also do not anchor the window, so a benefit entry dated in the current (still-running) month does not pull the window forward and drop an earlier month. Previously a current-month government-assistance entry could shift the window forward and drop the earliest month's paychecks, understating the gross monthly income; excluded sources no longer affect the window. These sources still count where they belong elsewhere, such as on Schedule I.

This applies to the standard six-month means test calculation. You can still choose to apply a single employer's year-to-date figures, or the YTD period method, to the means test instead; see [Document Collection](./document-collection.md).

### Chapter 7 Median Income Screen

The median income screen compares the client's annualized current monthly income directly against the household median income for their state and family size — deductions are not subtracted from this comparison. The result is shown clearly:

- A green check with the amount the client is **under** the median, per month, when income is below median.
- A red X with the amount the client is **over** the median, per month, when income is above median.
- The corresponding annual over/under amount is shown alongside the monthly figure.

Amounts of zero display as `$0.00` rather than a dash. When income or median data is missing, the screen shows a neutral state instead of a pass or fail.

### Paystub Data Extraction

When a paystub document is uploaded to a case, Glade extracts income fields automatically. YTD fields (such as year-to-date gross pay and year-to-date overtime) are used when the income source is set to YTD mode.

On paystubs that print current-period and year-to-date figures side by side, the two columns are kept apart: the pay-period gross is read from the current-period column and the year-to-date gross from the YTD column. Previously a year-to-date total could be recorded as the pay-period gross while the YTD figure was left blank, which showed income amounts that did not match the paystub and could overstate the monthly averages carried onto Schedule I and the means test.

### Automatic Re-extraction on Workflow Load

Some older income organizers may need their paystub data re-extracted (for example, after a backend improvement to how paystub data is read). Glade handles this automatically:

- When you open a workflow containing an income organizer that needs re-extraction, Glade kicks off the re-extraction in the background. You don't need to start it manually.
- A small **"Re-extracting paystubs..."** indicator appears in the corner of the income organizer while the work is in progress, so it's clear something is happening to the rows you're looking at.
- The indicator only shows when there are rows currently being processed. Once all rows finish, the indicator disappears and the updated data appears in the organizer.
- Only paystubs whose data has not already been extracted are re-processed. Paystubs that already have income data are left alone, so opening a workflow does not cause unnecessary re-work.
- If re-extraction fails for any reason, the organizer is left flagged for another attempt — opening the workflow again will retry. You can keep working in the meantime; the re-extraction runs in the background and does not block the rest of the workflow.

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Calculation mode | Per-paycheck, YTD, or YTD period method, set per income source |
| Filing (test) month | For the YTD period method, sets the month whose preceding six full months form the period being measured |
| Pay frequency | Used to convert YTD amounts to monthly figures (e.g., weekly = 52 periods/year) |

## Edge Cases & Limitations

- If a paystub does not include YTD overtime data, overtime shows as $0 in YTD mode — no error is shown. This is expected for clients without overtime.
- The Schedule I Contributions preview reflects the current saved state of the income sources. If you have made changes without saving, save first before reviewing the preview.
- YTD calculations depend on accurate pay period counts. If the number of pay periods elapsed is incorrect, monthly figures will be off proportionally.
- Paystubs extracted before the current/year-to-date column handling was corrected are not re-read automatically. If an existing row shows a year-to-date figure in its pay-period gross, re-run extraction on that row or correct the extracted data by hand.
- The YTD period method needs paystubs whose year-to-date sections bracket the chosen period. If there aren't enough anchoring paystubs, the method can't be applied and you'll be prompted to upload paystubs that bracket the window. The method always divides the bracketed gross by six months. Periods that cross a calendar-year boundary, and a July filing month, are handled as special cases.
